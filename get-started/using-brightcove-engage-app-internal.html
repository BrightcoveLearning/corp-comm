    <p>In this topic you will learn how to install and use the Brightcove Engage application on a mobile device. The installation process outlined in this topic should be used when you have created your own branded app with the assistance of Brightcove Consulting. Apple and Google may not approve internal only apps to their app stores which will require that the Brightcove Engage  be installed from somewhere other than an app store.</p>
    <p>Before installing the application, you should ensure the needed installation files for both iOS and Android are hosted at an  addressable location/URL.</p>
