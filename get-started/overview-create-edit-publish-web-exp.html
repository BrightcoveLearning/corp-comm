  <summary>In this topic you will learn about the basic steps to create, edit and publish a web experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>The Corp Comm app allows you to create engaging video experiences without the need for any technical resources. Web experiences follow responsive design principles so they look great on desktop, tablets and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>The following is an example of a web experience that was built using the Corp Comm web application template.</p>

    <p>For a step-by-step guide to building a web experience, check out <a href="/corp-comm/get-started/step-by-step-web-app.html">Step-by-Step: Creating and Publishing a Web Experience</a>.</p>
    <p>The main steps to create and publish a web experience are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#template">Choose a template</a></li>
      <li><a href="#customize">Add video and customize the experience</a></li>

    <h2 id="template">Choosing a template</h2>
    <p>When you create a new experience, you start by choosing a template. The template controls the overall look and feel of the experience. The Corp Comm app provides a set of templates that give you the flexibility to deliver the type of video experience needed to engage with your viewers. To learn more about templates and view some sample sites, see the <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/overview-experience-templates.html">Overview of Experience Templates</a> topic.</p>
    <p>After choosing a template, you have the option to <strong>Pre-Populate</strong> the experience with sample content. Clicking <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong> will pre-populate the experience with videos from your  account. This makes it easier to see what the experience will look like as you begin the customization process.</p>

    <h2 id="customize">Adding video and customizing the experience</h2>
    <p>After you create an experience, the <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/using-experience-editor-customize-web-experience.html">Experience Editor</a> is used to customize different aspects of the experience. The following types of customizations can be done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pages</strong> - Images, text and links can be added to page templates to brand the experience as needed. To learn more about adding objects to pages, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/customizing-content-web -experience-pages.html">Customizing the Content of Web Experience Pages</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Videos</strong> - Collections are created to select and organize video content. To learn more about adding video content to the site, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/adding-videos-experience.html">Adding Videos to an  Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Style </strong> - The look of the experience can be customized by selecting a new theme or by changing the site colors and fonts. To learn more about customizing the  style, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/customizing-style-web-experience.html">Customizing the Style of a Web Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Calls to Action</strong> - Some templates support calls to action which include banner ads and companion ads. To learn more about configuring calls to action, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/configuring-cta-web-experience.html">Configuring Calls to Action on a Web Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Site Configuration</strong> - Host the experience at a custom domain, secure it using SSL or restrict access to the site. To learn more about site configuration, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/customizing-site-config-web-experience.html">Customizing the Site Configuration of a Web Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong> - Edit the name, description and language for the experience. To learn more about editing the site overview, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/editing-experience-details.html">Editing Experience Details</a>.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="publish">Previewing and publishing the experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Experiences&nbsp;can be previewed in a new browser tab or a shareable link can be generated so others can preview the site. Publishing the experience generates a static URL for the site and makes it accessible to viewers. To learn more about previewing and publishing a web experience, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/previewing-publishing-web-experience.html">Previewing and Publishing a Portal Experience</a>.</p>
