    <h2 id="template">Choosing a template</h2>
    <p>When you create a new experience, you start by choosing a template. The template controls the overall look and feel of the experience. Brightcove Engage provides a set of templates that give you the flexibility to deliver the type of video experience needed to engage with your viewers. To learn more about templates and view some sample sites, see the <a href="/experiences/overview-experience-templates.html">Overview of Experience Templates</a> topic.</p>
    <p>After choosing a template, you have the option to <strong>Pre-Populate</strong> the experience with sample content. Clicking <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong> will pre-populate the experience with videos from your  account. This makes it easier to see what the experience will look like as you begin the customization process.</p>

    <h2 id="customize">Adding video and customizing the experience</h2>
    <p>After you create an experience, the <a href="/experiences/using-experience-editor-customize-web-experience.html">Experience Editor</a> is used to customize the experience. The following types of customizations can be done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pages</strong> - Images, text and links can be added to page templates to brand the experience as needed. To learn more about adding objects to pages, see <a href="/experiences/adding-objects-web-experience-pages.html">Customizing the Content of Web Experience Pages</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Videos</strong> - Collections are created to select and organize video content. To learn more about adding video content to the site, see <a href="/experiences/adding-videos-experience.html">Adding Videos to an  Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Style </strong> - The look of the experience can be customized by selecting a new theme or by changing the site colors and fonts. To learn more about customizing the  style, see <a href="/experiences/styling-web-experiences.html">Customizing the Style of a Web Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Control</strong> - Restrict access to the site. To learn more about site configuration, see <a href="/experiences/controlling-access-experience.html">Controlling Access to an Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong> - Edit the name, description and language for the experience. To learn more about editing the site overview, see <a href="/experiences/editing-experience-details.html">Editing Experience Details</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="publish">Previewing and publishing the experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Experiences&nbsp;can be previewed in a new browser tab or a shareable link can be generated so others can preview the site. Publishing the experience generates a static URL for the site and makes it accessible to viewers. To learn more about previewing and publishing a Web Experience, see <a href="/experiences/previewing-publishing-web-experience.html">Previewing and Publishing a Web Experience</a>.</p>
