    <h2 id="template">Choosing a template</h2>
    <p>When you create a new experience, you start by choosing a template. The template controls the overall look and feel of the experience. To learn more about templates and view some sample sites, see the <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/overview-experience-templates.html">Overview of Experience Templates</a> topic.</p>
    <p>After choosing a template, you have the option to <strong>Pre-Populate</strong> the experience with sample content. Clicking <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong> will pre-populate the experience with videos from your Video Cloud account. This makes it easier to see what the experience will look like as you begin the customization process.</p>

    <h2 id="customize">Adding video and customizing the experience</h2>
    <p>After you create an experience, the <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/using-experience-editor-customize-mobile-app-experience.html">Experience Editor</a> is used to customize different aspects of the experience. The following types of customizations can be done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pages</strong> - A logo can be added to page templates to brand the experience as needed. To learn more about adding a logo, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/adding-logo-mobile-app-experience-pages.html">Adding a Logo to a Mobile App Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Videos</strong> - Collections are created to select and organize video content. To learn more about adding video content to the experience, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/adding-videos-experience.html">Adding Videos to an  Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Style </strong> - The look of the experience can be customized by selecting a new theme or by changing the site colors. To learn more about customizing the  style, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/styling-mobile-app-experiences.html">Styling Mobile App Experiences</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Control</strong> - Host the site at a custom domain, secure it using SSL or restrict access to the site. To learn more about access control, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/controlling-access-experience.html">Controling Access to an Experience</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong> - Edit the name, description and language for the experience. To learn more about editing the site overview, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/editing-experience-details.html">Editing Experience Details</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="publish">Previewing and publishing the experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Experiences&nbsp;can be previewed in a new browser tab or a shareable link can be generated so others can preview the site. Publishing the experience generates a static URL for the site and makes it accessible to viewers. To learn more about previewing and publishing an experience, see <a href="/corp-comm/docs/experiences/previewing-publishing-mobile-app-experience.html">Previewing and Publishing a Mobile App Experience</a>.</p>
