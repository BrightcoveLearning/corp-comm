  <h1>Managing Videos</h1>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>To access the videos in the account, login to the <a href="https://studio.brightcove.com">Corporate Comm App</a> and click <strong>Videos</strong> in the navigation header.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/media/videos-homepage.png" /></figure>
    <p>The body of the page will display the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video thumbnail and duration </li>
      <li>Video name</li>
      <li>Video ID - System assigned video ID (unique across all accounts)</li>
      <li>Status
        <ul>
          <li><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/media/activate-icon.png" /> - Indicates the video is active</li>
          <li><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/media/deactivate-icon.png" /> - Indicates the video is inactive (can't be played)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Reference Id</li>
      <li><a href="#audit">Created date and time and user ID</a></li>
      <li><a href="#audit">Updated date and time and user ID</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The video thumbnail will indicate whether a video is shared into the account, or shared out to another account. In the example below, the Brown Pelican video is shared out to another account and the Horses Leaving the Paddock video was shared into this account.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14464-sharing.png" /></figure>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"></figure>
    <p>Multiple videos can be selected by clicking on a checkbox next to the video thumbnail and then shift-clicking on another checkbox. The list of videos can be sorted by clicking on a column header. The Videos page uses a "sticky" sort and will remember the sort selection. When you navigate away and come back or login again, the Videos page  will default to the sort that was last selected.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="audit">Created and updated date and time information</h2>
    <p>The user ID of the user who created and/or updated the video will be displayed in the Created Date/Updated Date columns. If the action was taken via the CMS API, <strong>Updated by API</strong> will be displayed. Note that if a user who performed an action is removed from an account, their ID will still appear.</p>
    <p>There are cases where changes made to a video will not record a user ID and cases where a user ID may not be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a video is retranscoded or if the video source is replaced, the updated date for the video will be updated but the user who initiated the action will not be recorded</li>
      <li>When the images (poster/thumbnail) and/or text tracks are updated, the updated date for the video will be updated but the user who initiated the action will not be recorded</li>
      <li>When a video is shared to an affiliate account, the created date will not display an associated user ID</li>
    </ul>
