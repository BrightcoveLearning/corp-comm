  <h1>Creating and Managing Live Events</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to create and manage live events.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The live video features in Brightcove Engage&trade; can be used to broadcast a live event to both Mobile App and Web experiences. After you create a live event, you will be provided with a set of encoder settings that you plug into your on-site encoder. All transcoding is done in the cloud so you don't need a hardware based transcoder. The live video can then be included when creating Mobile App and Web Experiences.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before you can broadcast a live event, the following items are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A camera to broadcast the event</li>
      <li>You must have your own encoding software, for example <a href="https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm">Telestream's Wirecast</a> or <a href="https://obsproject.com">Open Broadcaster Software</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Live broadcasts will experience a 20-30 second delay</li>
      <li>Streaming must begin within 30 minutes of the event start</li>
      <li>For users using Internet Explorer, version 10 or later is required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="create">Creating a new event</h2>
    <p>To create a new live event, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>From the Manage Events page click <strong>Create Event</strong>. The Create Live Event  page will open.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/live/new-live-event.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the event details:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Event Name</strong> - Name for the event; this name will also appear in the Videos page if the video is saved as a video asset (max 255 characters)</li>
          <li><strong>Short Description</strong> - Description of the event (max 250 characters)</li>
          <li><strong>Tags</strong> - Tags to associate with the event; tags will be assigned to the video if the video is saved as a video asset (max 128 characters and 1200 tags)</li>
          <li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - Reference ID for the event; must be unique (max 150 characters)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select <strong>Convert event to video asset when complete</strong> to save a video on demand version of the live video to your  account. <strong>Note that the VOD version is not available as soon as the live event ends, the video will be available once the upload processing is complete.</strong></li>
      <li>In the <strong>STREAM OPTIONS</strong> section, select a <strong>Region</strong>. The <strong>Region</strong> is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) region to use. To reduce latency, you should select the region that is closest to where your encoder is located. <strong>By default, the region is set to Oregon  which will produce bad results if you are streaming from another continent.</strong> The following regions are supported:
        <ul>
          <li>Oregon  (default)</li>
          <li>Virginia</li>
          <li>Tokyo</li>
          <li>Singapore</li>
          <li>Sydney</li>
          <li>Mumbai</li>
          <li>Frankfurt</li>
          <li>Ireland</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> and <a href="#advanced">configure the advanced options</a>.</li>
      <li>Click<strong> Create Event </strong>to start the live event. The <a href="#controlroom">Control Room page</a> will open with details about the live event including the <strong>Streaming Endpoint (RTMP URL)</strong> and <strong>Stream Name</strong> which will be used by your encoder.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/live/encoder-settings.png" /></figure>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: It will take about a minute to process your streams.</aside>
        <p>By default, the encoder must be started within 30 minutes from when a new event is created.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Click the <strong>Stop Streaming</strong> button to end the event.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Make sure the encoder is closed/stopped when the live stream is complete. Leaving a connection open between any encoder and Brightcove, even when no data is being sent, may result in unexpected connection charges.</aside>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="advanced">Configuring advanced options</h2>
    <p>When creating a new event, advanced options can be configured. To configure the advanced options, click the <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> link when creating the event.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/live/live-event-advanced-options.png" /></figure>
    <p>The following options can be configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content Encryption</strong> - Select the type of encryption to apply to the live stream:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>None</strong> - No encryption is applied</li>
          <li><strong>AES-128</strong> - Secure the stream using AES-128 encryption. If this option is selected, you must enter your <strong>Encryption Key</strong>. The key must be 32 hexadecimal characters. For best results, use a <a href="https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx">key generator</a>, choosing the <code translate="No">128-bit</code> and <code translate="No">Hex</code> options.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Clips can't be created from encrypted live streams.</aside>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Input Format</strong> - The input format from the encoder that will be sent to  Brightcove Live. This feature enables additional metadata in a live stream like now, now-next, more flexibility in subtitles and captioning, audio tracks and enables streamlined digital experiences with standard broadcast level data. The following input formats are supported:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>RTMP (default)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Secure Reliable Transport (SRT)</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>RTMP IP whitelist</strong> - Enter a set of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the RTMP endpoint. This controls who can connect to the RTMP endpoint. Note this option will only appear if the Input Format is RTMP.</li>
      <li><strong>CIDR Whitelist</strong>&nbsp; - Enter a set of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the RTP or SRT endpoint. This controls who can connect to the RTP or SRT endpoints. Note this option will only appear if the Input Format is RTP or SRT. </li>
      <li><strong>+ Add multi CDN configuration</strong> - Enter a <strong>label</strong> and <strong>URL</strong> for additional CDNs. This is a whitelist of CDNs that are allowed to ask our primary CDN for the video segments. You are responsible for configuring the secondary CDN correctly. </li>
    </ul>
