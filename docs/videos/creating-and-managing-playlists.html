    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The <strong>Videos</strong> page makes it easy to create playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created your playlist, you can publish a playlist in a Brightcove Engage&trade; application.</p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the list of videos in the playlist is constructed automatically, based on video tags or other video properties. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your video library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A maximum of 100 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the manual playlist.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mobile_app">Playlists and Mobile App experiences</h2>
    <p>When creating Mobile App experiences, the first video in the experience is used as the featured video. The featured video appears at the top of the application.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/add-videos-featured-video.png" /></figure>
    <p>Brightcove recommends creating a <strong>Featured Video</strong> playlist with one video so you can easily control the featured video that will appear. By doing this, the featured video can be easily be changed by editing the  playlist and selecting another video. This  allows you to easily make changes to the featured video without needing to edit and republish the application.</p>
