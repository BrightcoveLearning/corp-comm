<h1>Setting Required Fields for Videos</h1>
<summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure required fields for videos.</summary>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <p>Many publishers use video metadata (names, tags,  custom fields, etc.) as an essential tool to track and monetize their content. For video metadata to be effective, you need to make sure that each of the metadata fields you're depending on is actually present. The metadata assurance feature lets you designate which video metadata fields are important for your business purposes and then require users to complete the required metadata fields for new videos before the videos can become active.</p>
</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="designate">Designating metadata fields as required</h2>
  <p>Required video metadata fields are configured as part of the  account settings. Both standard and custom metadata fields can be marked as required. To configure  required fields, follow these steps.</p>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li>Login to Brightcove Engage.</li>
    <li>In the navigation header, click the gear icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/corp-comm/assets/images/admin/gear-icon.png" />) and then <strong>Video Fields</strong>. Note that you must be an account administrator to access to the administration menu.</li>
    <li>The Video Fields page will display any custom fields and all the standard video metadata fields.

    </li>
    <li>Click on the field name you want to set as required.</li>
    <li>Check the <strong>Make this Field Required</strong> checkbox.
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Video Fields page" src="/corp-comm/assets/images/admin/standard-field-required.png" /></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save Field</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At any time, you can uncheck the <strong>Make this Field Required</strong> checkbox for any field if you no longer want that field to be required. From that point on, Brightcove Engage will no longer check whether that field has been filled in.</p>
  <h3>Which metadata fields can be required fields?</h3>
  <p>The video name field is always required. Any custom metadata field can be marked as a required field. In addition, the following standard metadata fields can be required:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Short Description</li>
    <li>Long Description</li>
    <li>Related Link Text</li>
    <li>Related Link URL</li>
    <li>Scheduling Start Date</li>
    <li>Scheduling End Date</li>
    <li>Tags</li>
  </ul>

<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="missing">Videos without required metadata</h2>
  <p>If a video in your media library does not have all its required metadata, then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the video is already active, it remains active and playable. This allows any existing videos to remain playable after a metadata field is marked as required.</li>
    <li>If it's already active and you edit it on the <strong>Videos</strong> page, you cannot save your edits without supplying all required metadata in the section you're editing.</li>
    <li>If it is inactive, you cannot make it active without supplying all required metadata</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="uploading">Uploading videos without required metadata</h2>
  <p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status of the video is set to <strong>Active</strong> unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain <strong>Inactive</strong> until all of the required fields have values.</p>
</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="editing">Editing videos</h2>
  <p>If a video is inactive, you can freely edit and save its metadata in the Media module without supplying all required metadata. Also, the video can't be activated until all required metadata has been entered.</p>
  <p>If the video is already active, you cannot save any edits in the section you are editing unless you supply all required metadata in that section or deactivate the video.</p>

</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="activate">Activating videos</h2>
  <p>If you want to activate a video, it must have all its required metadata. If you try to activate a video with missing required metadata, an error will appear.</p>
  <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Activate error" src="/corp-comm/assets/images/admin/required-field-missing-error.png" /></figure>
  <h3>Workflow tip</h3>
  <p>Want to find all your inactive videos? On the <strong>Videos</strong> page, you can sort all your videos by <strong>Status</strong>. Just click in the header on the <strong>Status</strong> column. Then, you can edit each of the inactive videos to see what required metadata they may be missing.</p>
  <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Sort by status" src="/corp-comm/assets/images/admin/sort-by-status.png" /></figure>
</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
  <p>Required fields are enforced only on the <strong>Videos</strong> page. You can't activate an inactive video  unless all of its required metadata fields are complete. Note that  a video without required metadata fields could still become active if the video was created in your account and activated before you specified the required fields for your account.</p>
  <p>In addition, Brightcove Engage validates the type but does not validate the values of required metadata. As long as the value supplied has the correct type listed for the field in the Account Settings (for example, text, URL, or date), users can enter whatever values they choose.</p>
